/**
 * The CollectionHandler class is responsible for managing the collection of tickets.
 * It provides methods to access and manipulate the collection, as well as retrieve information about the collection.
 * The collection is stored as a LinkedList of Ticket objects.
 * The class also maintains separate lists for ticket IDs and venue IDs, stored as ArrayLists of Long.
 * The creation time of the collection is stored as a ZonedDateTime object.
 *
 * This class provides the following methods:
 * - getCollection(): Returns the collection of tickets as a LinkedList<Ticket>.
 * - getTicketIdList(): Returns the list of ticket IDs as an ArrayList<Long>.
 * - getVenueIdList(): Returns the list of venue IDs as an ArrayList<Long>.
 * - getCreatingtime(): Returns the creation time of the collection as a formatted string.
 * - findIndexById(Long id): Finds the index of a ticket in the collection based on its ID.
 *
 * The format of the creation time string is "MM/dd/yyyy - HH:mm:ss Z".
