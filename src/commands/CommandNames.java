 * - update: updates an existing element in the program
 * - removeById: removes an element from the program by its ID
 * - clear: removes all elements from the program
 * - save: saves the program state to a file
 * - executeScript: executes a script file containing a sequence of commands
 * - exit: exits the program
 * - insertAtIndex: inserts an element at a specific index in the program
 * - shuffle: shuffles the elements in the program
